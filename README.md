# Birthday Paradox
This is my approachment to resolve the birthday paradox, that looks to find the number of people needed to have at least 2 of them sharing their birthday.

In order to actual get the right median, a big sample is needed. This median shuld be around 23.

This is a refactor of [my first approachment](https://github.com/Alejandroacho/BirthdayParadox/commit/67528beb73c44cb6302b95e279524588e93361f3).
